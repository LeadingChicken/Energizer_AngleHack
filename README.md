## Heineken Image Detection & Analytics Optimization Project
Welcome to our project repository! This project leverages state-of-the-art AI technologies, including YOLOv8 for object detection and LLaVA as a Large Language Model (LLM), to enhance image detection, data entry, analytics, conversion rate, and ROI for Heineken's marketing and sales strategies.
## Project Overview
# Objective
The main objective of this project is to optimize Heineken's marketing efforts through advanced image detection and analytics. By accurately detecting and analyzing images related to Heineken products and advertisements, we aim to improve data-driven decision-making, streamline data entry processes, and ultimately boost conversion rates and ROI.

# Technologies Used
* Roboflow: an effective computer vision tool that helps the team label together and upload trained models
* YOLOv8: A highly efficient object detection model that identifies and classifies objects within images in real-time.
* LLaVA (Large Language and Vision Assistant): An advanced LLM that integrates language and vision capabilities to enhance image detection, data interpretation, and analytics.
# Features
* Image Detection: Utilizing YOLOv8, the system can accurately detect and classify Heineken products and related objects in images.
* Data Entry Automation: By integrating LLaVA, the project automates the extraction and entry of relevant data from detected images into databases and analytics platforms.
* Analytics Enhancement: LLaVA's advanced analytics capabilities provide deeper insights into image data, enabling more informed marketing strategies.
* Conversion Rate Optimization: By analyzing the effectiveness of various marketing images, the project helps identify the most impactful visuals, thereby improving conversion rates.
